        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These tasty snacks are liked for their light and sweet top and bottom 
           shell, along with a filling of buttercream, jam, or ganache.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup almond meal</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). 
            Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li> 
            <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, 
                about 5 minutes. Whisk superfine sugar into egg whites until 
                thick, glossy, and stiff peaks form, 5 to 8 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites; 
                gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.</li>
            <li>Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired.</li>
            <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. 
                Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, 
                leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
            <li>Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the work surface to 
                adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool completely 
                on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper, about 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
